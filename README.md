# Wheat Disease Detection using CNN

This project focuses on detecting wheat leaf diseases using a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN). The system classifies leaf images as Healthy or Diseased
to enable early disease identification.

## Objective
- Automate wheat disease detection using images
- Support early intervention and reduce crop loss
- Minimize excessive pesticide usage

## Project Structure
wheat-disease-detection/

- test.py
- README.md

## Technologies
Python, TensorFlow/Keras, CNN, NumPy, OpenCV

## How to Run
1. Install libraries:
   pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python
2. Train model:
   python train.py
3. Test model:
   python test.py

## Output
Predicts wheat leaf condition and suggests basic pesticide treatment.
